A github respreotory with scripts developed for STEM-data processing as follows:

A code designed to segment large ensembles of heterogeneous nanocrystals and obtain a chemical composition on individual nanocrystals. this code utilizes the segment every grain algorithm (SEG) to segment individual nanocrystals in the HAADF image, the SEG algorithm can be found here: https://github.com/zsylvester/segmenteverygrain
