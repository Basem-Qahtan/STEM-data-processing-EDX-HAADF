# STEM-data-processing-EDX-HAADF

a code designed to segment large ensembles of heterogeneous nanocrystals and obtain a chemical composition on individual nanocrystals. this code utilizes the segment every grain algorithm (SEG) to segment individual nanocrystals in the HAADF image, the SEG algorithm can be found here: https://github.com/zsylvester/segmenteverygrain
