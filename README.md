A github respreotory with scripts developed for STEM-data processing as follows:

1-Nanocrystals segmentation and population analysis.
A code designed to segment large ensembles of heterogeneous nanocrystals and obtain a chemical composition on individual nanocrystals. this code utilizes the segment every grain algorithm (SEG) to segment individual nanocrystals in the HAADF image, the SEG algorithm can be found here: [segment every grain algorithm](https://github.com/zsylvester/segmenteverygrain) 
Additional watershed segmentation was added for segmentartion of agglomerated nanocrystals.
